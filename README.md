But not to worry the Euro 2024 is here! Pure excitement of a knockout tournament with the finest footballing nations Europe has to offer. Before the kick off today I would like us to look into the previous tournament.


In a world reeling from a pandemic, Euro 2020 emerged as a beacon of hope, unity and pure entertainment for football lovers. Postponed but not forgotten, the tournament showcased 24 teams across 51 matches, creating a footballing spectacle that reignited our passion for the beautiful game. With an incredible 142 goals scored, averaging 2.78 goals per game, this tournament was a thrilling testament to the sport’s enduring magic.


The anticipation was over the roof as Euro 2020 kicked off, promising a tournament like no other. The previous editions had set the stage with memorable moments, but the 2020 tournament shattered records and expectations. Back in 2008, Austria and Switzerland jointly hosted a tournament that saw 77 goals over 31 matches. The excitement continued in Poland and Ukraine in 2012, with 76 goals in the same number of matches. Fast forward to 2016 in France, where 108 goals were netted across 51 games, setting a high bar for future tournaments.

As we delved into the details, the strategic brilliance of the teams became evident through the timing of the goals. The opening 15 minutes of matches saw 13 goals, a testament to teams looking to seize early advantages. The tempo increased between the 16th and 30th minutes with 16 goals, and just before halftime, another 18 goals were scored, reflecting teams' desire to head into the break on a high.

However, it was the period just after halftime, from the 46th to the 60th minute, that proved most prolific with 30 goals. This burst of energy and tactical adjustments during halftime often changed the game’s dynamics.

They say “Attack wins you games, defense wins you titles”, and Euro 2020 was no different. England stood out with an impressive five clean sheets, a feat that highlighted their solid defensive strategies. Belgium and Italy, each with three clean sheets, also showcased defensive brilliance that proved pivotal in their progress through the tournament.

Moreover, the teams that conceded the fewest goals also deserve recognition. England again led the pack, conceding only two goals, followed by Belgium and Finland, each conceding just three. These statistics underscore the importance of a robust defense in tournament football, where a single goal can be the difference between victory and defeat.

Ball control and precision passing were key elements that defined the tactical battles of Euro 2020 I mean if your opponent don’t have the ball they can’t score you. Spain dominated possession with an impressive 67%, utilizing their well-known tiki-taka style to control matches. Germany and the Netherlands followed, with 59% and 55% possession respectively, showcasing their own versions of ball control and movement.

In terms of passing accuracy, Germany, Spain, and Portugal led the way with 89% accuracy, demonstrating their commitment to maintaining possession and building attacks through meticulous ball movement. Belgium and Italy, with 87% accuracy, also exemplified this approach, proving that precision passing was crucial to creating scoring opportunities and dictating the pace of the game.

The tournament's attacking prowess was highlighted by the top goal-scoring teams. Italy the eventual winners and Spain each scored 13 goals, while Denmark followed closely with 12. These teams not only scored frequently but also made the most of their opportunities. Italy's conversion rate of 9.8% was the highest, reflecting their clinical finishing. Czechia and Switzerland also impressed with conversion rates of 9.5% and 8.6% respectively, showcasing their efficiency in front of goal.
